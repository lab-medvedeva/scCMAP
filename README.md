# scCMAP
Computational search for target genes for chemical reprograming of the cells using gene regulatory networks

scINTREGNET can be used to improve results of the [Connectivity Mapping (CMAP)](https://www.broadinstitute.org/connectivity-map-cmap) pipeline for drug repurposing by accounting of Transription-Regulation-Network for target cell population and providing core transcription factors as drug targets.
